# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in xfetch, please report it privately to the maintainers by email: mojoaar@atomicmail.io

Do not create a public issue for security-sensitive information. After receiving a report we will acknowledge and respond with a timeline for fixes.

Security fixes will be released promptly and may be coordinated with downstream package managers.
